            "description": "This skill has two purposes:\n1) Instead of triggering a skill by asking Mycroft a question, this skill triggers when a text message is received on mqtt.\nIt can be used for notifications. For instance, a smart home server could publish the text \"Somebody is at the door\", if the doorbell is pressed.\nIt is possible to make Mycroft repeat the last text it received on mqtt.\n\n2) Send an utterance in text from mqtt, to activate other skills. For instance, if your\nhome automation detect that a window is opened, send the text \"_utterance remind me to close the window in 10 minutes\" on mqtt to\ntrigger the \"reminder\" skill.\n\n\n### Configuration\nThe skill is configured on your \"Mycroft Home\" page. Configure the mqtt server, port and topic that the skill will listen for text messages on.\nCurrently, password or certificates are not supported. (Maybe I will implement it if you promise to test it :)\n\nTwo topics are available in the configuration: \"Mqtt topic\" and \"Mqtt alert topic\".\nThe \"Mqtt alert topic\" is a priority topic, that will always be active, even if mycroft is sleeping.\nThe \"Mqtt topic\" will be silent if mycroft is sleeping. You can put mycroft to sleep by using the command \"Hey Mycroft, go to sleep\".\n\nA restart of the skill is needed when changing the configuration.\n\nOptionally, it is possible to split the text, using a regular expression.\n\nExample CamelCase: If you send the string \"KitchenWindow is open\",\nyou want to split KitchenWindow. After the split Mycroft will say \"Kitchen Window is open\". To do that set the parameters on \"Mycroft Home\" like this:\n* Split text at pattern (optional): `[a-z][A-Z]`\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"nK\" in \"KitchenWindow is open\". We retain the characters until index 1 of \"nK\", which is n.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"nK\", which is K. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample hypen: Convert \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\" to \"Outside temperature is -5 degrees\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): `[a-z|A-Z]-[a-z|A-Z]`\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 2\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"e-t\" in \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\".  We retain the characters until index 1 of \"e-t\", which is e.\nWe retain the characters after index 2 of \"e-t\", which is t. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample underscore: Convert \"Kitchen_window is open\" to \"Kitchen Window is open\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): _\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 0\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"_\" in \"Kitchen_window is open\".  We retain the characters until index 0 of \"_\", which is no characters.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"_\", which is no characters. And we put a space in the middle.",

            "description": "Get listings of US National Parks by state, have Mycroft read descriptions of  national parks and even test your knowledge of where National Parks are located.  \n\nTo use this skill  you will need to obtain an API key from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm).  Just follow the link and fill in the form, it's free and you will not be required to create an account.  When the skill is installed there will be a new settings entry in the Skills section of [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) under National Parks.  Paste in your API key and click the Save button.  As soon as the skill picks up the API key it will be able to connect to the NPS servers.\n  \nFor the purpose of this skill the term \"National Park\" is used loosely to refer to almost any property managed by the US National Park Service.  Properties with a designation of  National Monument, National Historic Site or National Recreation Area will be included in park listings.   The only designation that is explicitly excluded from park listings is National Historic Trail.  All information is provided by the National Park Service.\n\nWhen asking for a park description the skill will do a search on the words given, so one does not need to say the complete park name.  For example, 'describe Edgar national park\", \"describe Edgar Allan national park\" and \"describe Edgar Allan Poe national park\" will all provide a description of Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.  \n\nSince definite articles are dropped from speech, searches for descriptions of some properties will fail if they are included.  For example, trying to hear a description of Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park by saying \"describe Rosie the Riveter national park\" will fail but \"describe Rosie national park\" and \"describe Riveter national park\" will succeed.\n\nAfter asking to be quizzed Mycroft will ask what state a particular National Park Service property is in.  The answer may be spoken after the beep without using the wake word but there will only be a few seconds to answer.  If Mycroft does not respond to the answer use the wake word with \"Repeat national parks quiz\" and answer after the beep.",

You can find a detailed definition of a **habit** on the [project page](https://github.com/PFE1718/mycroft-habits-automation).\n\nThis skill allows you to automate some of the habits that Mycroft has detected and it handles their automation. When you first reproduce a detected habit, Mycroft will ask you if this habit should be automatized.\n\nThe habit detection is done by two other complementary skills:\n1. The [**skill-listener**](https://github.com/PFE1718/mycroft-skill-listener), that logs the user activity. It is also  responsible for launching the 2 other skills when needed.\n2. The [**habit-miner**](https://github.com/PFE1718/mycroft-habit-miner-skill), that extracts the habits of the user from the logs.",

In the real world however many different temperaments may be\nused - see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament - and octaves too can vary in\nsize, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretched_octave.\n\nAlso Mycroft call middle C for \"C4\" : this is the commonest octave numbering but some\npeople call middle C for \"C3\" or even for \"C5\".",

            "description": "This skill has two purposes:\n1) Instead of triggering a skill by asking Mycroft a question, this skill triggers when a text message is received on mqtt.\nIt can be used for notifications. For instance, a smart home server could publish the text \"Somebody is at the door\", if the doorbell is pressed.\nIt is possible to make Mycroft repeat the last text it received on mqtt.\n\n2) Send an utterance in text from mqtt, to activate other skills. For instance, if your\nhome automation detect that a window is opened, send the text \"_utterance remind me to close the window in 10 minutes\" on mqtt to\ntrigger the \"reminder\" skill.\n\n\n### Configuration\nThe skill is configured on your \"Mycroft Home\" page. Configure the mqtt server, port and topic that the skill will listen for text messages on.\nCurrently, password or certificates are not supported. (Maybe I will implement it if you promise to test it :)\n\nA restart of the skill is needed when changing the configuration.\n\nOptionally, it is possible to split the text, using a regular expression.\n\nExample CamelCase: If you send the string \"KitchenWindow is open\",\nyou want to split KitchenWindow. After the split Mycroft will say \"Kitchen Window is open\". To do that set the parameters on \"Mycroft Home\" like this:\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z][A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"nK\" in \"KitchenWindow is open\". We retain the characters until index 1 of \"nK\", which is n.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"nK\", which is K. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample hypen: Convert \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\" to \"Outside temperature is -5 degrees\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z|A-Z]-[a-z|A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 2\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"e-t\" in \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\".  We retain the characters until index 1 of \"e-t\", which is e.\nWe retain the characters after index 2 of \"e-t\", which is t. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample underscore: Convert \"Kitchen_window is open\" to \"Kitchen Window is open\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): _\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 0\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"_\" in \"Kitchen_window is open\".  We retain the characters until index 0 of \"_\", which is no characters.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"_\", which is no characters. And we put a space in the middle.",

The default work time is 25 minutes, the default break time is 5 minutes and the default long break time is 15 minutes.\n2. If you want to change the work time or the break time in speech, say the work time first.\n3. Not recommended to put the break time longer than the work time.\n4. Not recommended to put the work and break time too short (below 10 seconds).\n\n### Terminology:\n1. A cycle is one finished work and one finished break.\n2. A run is four finished cycles.\n3. A long break is a duration taken each run.\n4. A session is all works and breaks taken after stopping pomodoro.\n\n### TODO:\n1. Make a record to store the sessions.\n2. Ask to save the session each time finishes.\n3. Keep record of distractions during the session.\n4. Integrate with the enclosure.\n5. Switchable fun mode!",

A workaround is restarting the skill (or restarting Mycroft).\nThe problem only affects this skill. I am still looking for a solution to this.\n\n\n### Configuration\nThe skill is configured on your \"Mycroft Home\" page. Configure the mqtt server, port and topic that the skill will listen for text messages on.\nCurrently, password or certificates are not supported. (Maybe I will implement it if you promise to test it :)\n\nA restart of the skill is needed when changing the configuration.\n\nOptionally, it is possible to split the text, using a regular expression.\n\nExample CamelCase: If you send the string \"KitchenWindow is open\",\nyou want to split KitchenWindow. After the split Mycroft will say \"Kitchen Window is open\". To do that set the parameters on \"Mycroft Home\" like this:\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z][A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"nK\" in \"KitchenWindow is open\". We retain the characters until index 1 of \"nK\", which is n.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"nK\", which is K. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample hypen: Convert \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\" to \"Outside temperature is -5 degrees\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z|A-Z]-[a-z|A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 2\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"e-t\" in \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\".  We retain the characters until index 1 of \"e-t\", which is e.\nWe retain the characters after index 2 of \"e-t\", which is t. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample underscore: Convert \"Kitchen_window is open\" to \"Kitchen Window is open\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): _\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 0\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"_\" in \"Kitchen_window is open\".  We retain the characters until index 0 of \"_\", which is no characters.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"_\", which is no characters. And we put a space in the middle.",

Zap2iT is optional but will allow mycroft to tell you what is playing on the current channel.  Without it, it will only tell you the channel.\n\nCurrently, the following functions are working:\n* \"Tivo status\"\n* \"Tivo channel up\"\n* \"Tivo channel down\"\n* \"Tivo channel set 2 3 1\"\n* \"Tivo pause\"\n* \"Tivo play\"\n* \"Tivo off\"\n* \"Tivo on\"\n\nThese functions should be working but require some additional testing.  These are specifically to initiate and stop a recording in progress:\n* \"Tivo record\"\n* \"Tivo stop\"\n\nMycroft will respond with, e.g.:\n* \"Bob's Tivo is currently watching channel 231\"\n* \"Bob's Tivo is currently watching channel 231 Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (with your zap2it account setup and with the correct lineup selected with their service)\n* \"Bob's Tivo is off\"\n* \"Bob's Tivo is playing\"",

A command is transmitted through text in the URI.\nThis works fine from desktop using browser or from Android devices (smartphone or tablet) using an API I wrote thanks to Thunkable.\nIt was too difficult to resist doing the same with Mycroft !",

            "description": "This skills allows to turn on/off, the Red/Green LEDs attached with NodeMCU microcontroller.\nIt is using Thinger.io (https://thinger.io/) server installed on local machine to control the\nLEDs through REST API calls. Thinger.io server provides an interface to manage all the IoT resources\nand automatically creates REST APIs with secure authentication mechanism to control the resources.\nThis skill at present only providing voice control for turning Red/Green led ON of OFF.\nBut it could be extended or new skills can be created using same tools to give Mycroft more capabilities to\ncontrol IoT devices via voice. As an example, room temperature sensor could be added to the NodeMCU board ( L35 analog temperature sensor is used here, check this article for\ntutorial on how to connect it with NodeMCU : http://www.instructables.com/id/Interface-LM35-With-NodeMCU/ ) and with few code addition, this skill allows Mycroft to fetch room temperature reading using voice command.\nThis skill has not yet been submitted to Mycroft skill set, as some code modifications ( like reading the authentication headers from config files) need to be done.\nThe sketch is also provided with this code (NodeMCUThinger.ino) which can be flashed into a NodeMCU unit.\nAlso, this repository contains a PDF file with overview of components required for creating and using this skill.\nDemo videos on YouTube:\n1. https://youtu.be/2W1dCUOKwTw    Demo to turn LEDs ON/OFF\n2. https://youtu.be/Tw6L6K-t1TA    Demo to query room temperature\n3. https://youtu.be/Zdkx1vZKKfw    Screencast walkthrough under the hood.",

There is a daisy-chain serial bus jumping from one LED to the next to form the chain.  The first LED is connected to a ESP8266 NodeMCU module.  There is a 3V3 / 5V level shifter in between.  The ESP8266 runs an Arduino sketch that commands the LEDs.  There are several modes.\n\nOff.\nFade up to full white.\n50% white.\n100% white.\n50% blue.\n100% blue.\n50% green.\n100% green.\n50% red.\n100% red.\n50% yellow.\n100% yellow.\nKnight rider chase in red with after glow.\nRunning random colour changing.\n\nThe ESP8266 presents a simple web page via wifi that allow the light modes to be selected via radio buttons and an Action button.\n\nThis skill generates the form extension to the web site call, that commands the mode of the light bar.\n\nMy light bar is static on 192.168.1.19.\n\nWhile this repository does not conatain the light bar sketch it does show a working example of writing form data to a web page.

If the automatic installation of dependencies doesn't work, try downgrading to pip 9.0.3 first:\n`pip install pip==9.0.3`.\n\nThen, install Program-Y manually using `pip install programy`.\n\nThis will break Mycroft in its current state as one of the dependencies requires `websocket-client>=0.35.0` to work. As a result, pip will update websocket-client to a version that Mycroft in turn does not support anymore. Downgrade to 0.35.0 and you should be fine:\n\n```pip install websocket-client==0.35.0```\n\nIf the lxml install fails, do the following:\n```\nsudo apt install -y libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev python3-pip\nsudo pip3 install lxml\n```\nNote that the installation of lxml can be _very_ slow on low RAM devices like the Raspberry Pi (I am talking in the order of 10min+!). If you\never doubt that it's even doing anything, open another terminal and run `htop` on it.",

Peek into the history of gaming, experiencing some of the very earliest examples of interactive worlds using only text -- but this time using your voice!\n\n### Original Infocom Description\n![](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/hhgttg/front_th.jpg)\n\nAs the story begins, you are Arthur Dent, and a bulldozer is preparing to level your house even as an alien space fleet is preparing to level your planet. The incorrigible Mr. Adams has written new material and designed problems, especially for this interactive story. So grab a pint of bitter and a couple for the road and join Ford Prefect, Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin on a cosmic jaunt into the outer reaches where anything can -- and does -- happen. And don't forget your towel!\n\nExample Gameplay:\n\n ``play hitchiker guide``\n\n  > you wake up\n  > the room is spinning very gently round your head\n  > or at least it would be if you could see it which you can't\n  > \n > it is pitch black\n > \n > \n\n ``turn on light``\n\n > good start to the day\n > pity it's going to be the worst one of your life\n > \n > the light is now on\n > bedroom, in the bed the bedroom is a mess\n > it is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper\n > there is a washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a window with the curtains drawn\n > near the exit leading south is a phone\n > there is a flathead screwdriver here\n > (outside the bed) there is a toothbrush here",

There is a parameter called spoken which  has the utterances. You can grab this request using a do_POST method in a server. The POST URL is http://localhost:15000. I got the idea for this skill from a  friend who runs a travel company catering to the disabled. She wanted me to create a speech to sign language converter. I then subsequently thought that it would be easier to create a mechanism to output spoken text. I expect this skill to be used in conferences etc. However, it has not been tested in the field.",

The skill has the ability to send messages (intercom) and commands (messagebus) to one or more remote Mycroft units.\n1. Each Mycroft unit has the ability to publish both Mycroft requests and responses to the the MQTT broker.\nThe MQTT Topics for this communication is...\n* ```/RemoteDevices/deviceUUID/request```\n* ```/RemoteDevices/deviceUUID/response```\n2. The deviceUUID is a unique ID created from the MAC of the sending Mycroft unit.\n*This is intended to be a general MQTT broadcast and can be subscribed to by any MQTT client (ie. Home Assistant?).\n3. Each Mycroft unit has it's own Device Name (location_id) that can be set in the web interface.\n4. The Mycroft unit will automatically subscribe to all messages sent to it's own Device Name (location_id).\n* ```/RemoteDevices/```\n* The  is automatically obtained from the Mycroft Device Settings web page...\n![location_id](/images/location_id.png)\n* location id's are automatically converted to lowercase to avoid confusion\n\n5. When a message is sent from any Mycroft unit, the message will be published to \"Mycroft/RemoteDevices/location_id\".\n6. The destination location_id is specified in the skill dialog.\n7. The message payload will contain the following Json...\n* ```{\"source\":\"\", \"message\":\"is dinner ready yet\"}```",

Spotify\nPremium users can search and play tracks from their own playlists or the huge\nSpotify music library.\n\nYou can also control your Mycroft device using the Spotify Connect system.\nSo play DJ on your phone while listening on Mycroft!\n\n### Authorization:\nThis Skill uses two different methods of authentication. Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.\n\n#### API connection to your Spotify account\nAfter installing `mycroft-spotify`, in your [Skill\nsettings for Spotify](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill) in home.mycroft.ai you will see settings for the Spotify Skill. You will see a username and password field and a 'Connect' button. Ignore the username and password field for now, and click the 'Connect' button. You will be prompted to log in to Spotify, and to authorize Mycroft AI to use your Spotify account using OAuth. This allows Mycroft access to your account details such as Playlists.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spot-ify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._",

            "description": "Mycroft will announce estimated arrival times of MBTA buses at your stop so you never leave the house before you have to.  All data and arrival predictions used by this skill are provided by the MBTA.\n\nSee below for full documentation, including how to track buses traveling toward your stop, but to get started just say \"Hey Mycroft, T Bus Arrivals\".  You will be prompted for the bus route, direction and stop name.  Mycroft will respond with all estimated arrival times at your stop.\n\nView Sample dialog\n\nHey Mycroft T Bus Arrivals\nWhich route are you riding?\nOne\nAre you going outbound toward Harvard or Inbound toward Dudley?\nInbound\nWhich stop?\nMount Auburn Street at Putnam Ave\nRoute One service to Dudley arrivals for Mount Auburn Street at Putnam Avenue:\nArriving in 11 minutes\nArriving in 21 minutes\nArriving in 34 minutes\n\n\n\nView Full Documentation\n\n#### T bus or Transit\n\nWherever this documentation calls for saying \"T bus\" to Mycroft it can be replaced with \"transit\", and vice versa.  If Mycroft is having difficulty understanding  one, try the other.\n\n#### Arrival Times\n\nTo provide bus arrival times the skill requires three pieces of information:  bus route, traveling direction and bus stop.  If you do not provide all information needed the skill will prompt you for the rest.  For example, saying\n\n> T bus arrivals route 57 going inbound stop Brighton Ave and Linden Street\n\nwill retrieve all arrival times predicted for the stop.  The arrival times could also be retrieved by any of the following:\n\n> T bus arrivals route 57 going inbound\n\n> T bus arrivals route 57\n\n> T bus arrivals\n\nMycroft will prompt for any missing information.\n\n#### Bus Tracking\n\nBus tracking is similar to Arrival Times but Mycroft will continue to track buses, periodically updating their predicted arrival times, until they have passed the stop.  By default Mycroft will track the next three buses and will announce updated arrival predictions every 30 seconds.  These values can be changed in the skill settings on Mycroft Home.  The minimum frequency of updates  is 30 seconds.\n\nAs with Arrivals, say\n\n> T bus tracking\n\nto begin.  Predicted arrival times of the next three tracked buses will be announced right away and updated every 30 seconds.  Be aware that there may be any number of buses heading to your stop but only the arrival predictions for the tracked buses will be announced.\n\nWhen a bus passes your stop it will drop off the tracking list and there will be one fewer arrival time announced on subsequent updates.  When all buses have passed your stop Mycroft will automatically stop tracking.  If you would like tracking to end at any time say\n\n> T bus shutdown\n\n#### Shortcuts\n\nIf you ride the same route from the same stop often you will want to use shortcuts.  After Mycroft announces arrivals or starts tracking buses you may save the route, direction and stop combination as a shortcut using any name you wish.\n\nSuppose you take the bus to work and went through the process of asking for arrivals, telling Mycroft the bus route, direction and stop.  Now say\n\n> transit save shortcut\n\nand Mycroft will prompt you for a name.  If you say\n\n> rat race\n\nyou may get Arrivals or begin Bus Tracking using the shortcut\n\n>T bus tracking rat race\n\nTwo additional phrases\n\n> list T bus shortcuts\n\n> T bus remove shortcut rat race\n\nallow you to list and delete saved shortcuts.\n\n#### API Key\n\nWhen installed this skill does not use an API key when getting data from the MBTA servers.  Using a key allows a higher rate limit when requesting data.  It should not be necessary to use an API key but if you like you may obtain one on the [MBTA website](https://api-v3.mbta.com/register). In the skill settings on Mycroft Home check the box next to \"Use my API key\" and enter your key in the text field.\n\n",

Or if no rude word is detected, allows Mycroft to respond normally.\n\nFor more details see the [technical documentation on converse](https://mycroft-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/mycroft.html?highlight=converse#mycroft.MycroftSkill.converse).",

This Skill shows both reading data from a GPIO port (detecting a button press) and writing data to the port (illuminating an LED).\n\n### Preparation\n\n[You will need to first install the GPIO libraries for Picroft, and add some additional permissions](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/#using-the-gpio-pins-on-the-raspberry-pi-3).\n\n### Generation\n\nThe documentation is done using Sphinx, which picks up comments from the code.  The following will generate the html docs.\n\n```make docs```\n\nYou can then find the generated html in ```docs/build/html/index.html```.  Open that file in your browser and you should be able to navigate to the docs.\n\n### Installing from the `makefile`\n\n* Change the Makefile IP address for the RPi installation to the IP address of your RPi.\n\nThat is, edit the file `makefile` using your favorite editor like `nano` or `vi`.\n\nThe line you will need to change is `scp -r * pi@192.168.205.115:/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`.\n\nChange this to have the IP address of your RPi.\n\n* Create the folder ```/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio``` on the RPi for the installer.\n\nYou can do this by using the command `mkdir /opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`\n\n* Build the code using the `makefile`.  ```make install.pi```\n\n### Testing the `makefile`\n\n```make test.pi```\n\nThis will run a test to be sure you have access to the GPIO and will report any errors that are identified.\n\n### Notes\n\nIf the LED blinking is too fast, it will be difficult to get a command to execute because there will be a voice response when the the LED turns off and on.

It asks the patient basic questions about his health.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe skill is activated by saying the wake word (which, by default is `hey mycroft` but will be changed) and asking help:\n\n`Hey Mycroft, puoi aiutarmi?`\n\nThen, the interaction begins: the bot asks if it's talking directly with the patient. This helps us understands if he/she's conscious. Then, it asks about the main symptom. Right now, it recognises:\n\n- Faints\n- Hemorrhages\n- Shocks\n- Breathing difficulties\n- Fractures (extracting the affected limb)\n- Fevers\n- Burns\n- Abdominal pains\n\nIf the declared symptom is compatible with the COVID19, the bot asks some questions to determine the `covid_score`, an index determining how likely the patient is affected by COVID19.\n\nIt then assigns the patient a color code, according to the CESIRA index, and asks him/her to quantify the pain. Finally, it asks the patient his/her age and creates a `med_record` object containing all the gathered informations. This `med_record` can then be exported to assist the doctor during the checks.",

This Skill shows both reading data from a GPIO port (detecting a button press) and writing data to the port (illuminating an LED).\n\n### Preparation\n\n[You will need to first install the GPIO libraries for Picroft, and add some additional permissions](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/#using-the-gpio-pins-on-the-raspberry-pi-3).\n\n### Installing from the `makefile`\n\n* Change the Makefile IP address for the RPi installation to the IP address of your RPi.\n\nThat is, edit the file `makefile` using your favorite editor like `nano` or `vi`.\n\nThe line you will need to change is `scp -r * pi@192.168.205.115:/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`.\n\nChange this to have the IP address of your RPi.\n\n* Create the folder ```/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio``` on the RPi for the installer.\n\nYou can do this by using the command `mkdir /opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`\n\n* Build the code using the `makefile`.  ```make install.pi```\n\n### Notes\n\nIf the LED blinking is too fast, it will be difficult to get a command to execute because there will be a voice response when the the LED turns off and on. Turn the blinking to a lower frequency to be able to execute commands.",

Spotify\nPremium users can search and play tracks from their own playlists or the huge\nSpotify music library.\n\nYou can also control your Mycroft device using the Spotify Connect system.\nSo play DJ on your phone while listening on Mycroft!\n\n### This skill doesn't do any playback\nThis skill works with the Spotify Connect protocol to interact with Spotify devices, but doesn't perform any playback itself. If you want playback on the hosting Mycroft device, you'll need to set up a player yourself.\n\nFor Picroft users, [raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) is a good choice.\n\nInstall it and then make changes to `/etc/default/raspotify.conf` as follows\n\n\n`DEVICE_NAME=\"<My Mycroft Unit>\"\n\n\n`OPTIONS=\"--username <My Username> --password <My Password>\"`\n\n\nYou make sound work with raspotify you may need to edit `/lib/systemd/system/raspotify.service` and there change `User` and `Group` from `raspotify`to `pi`.\n\n\nFor desktop users the official spotify player works well.\n\nThe exception to this is the Mark-1 which is shipped with a spotify player library.\n\n### Authorization:\nThis Skill uses two different methods of authentication. Both need to be filled in correctly for the **Skill** to function correctly.\n\n#### API connection to your Spotify account\nAfter installing `mycroft-spotify`, in your [Skill\nsettings for Spotify](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill) in home.mycroft.ai you will see settings for the Spotify Skill. You will see a username and password field and a 'Connect' button. Ignore the username and password field for now, and click the 'Connect' button. You will be prompted to log in to Spotify, and to authorize Mycroft AI to use your Spotify account using OAuth. This allows Mycroft access to your account details such as Playlists.\n\n#### Username and password to authenticate a Mycroft device\nIn addition to account details, Mycroft needs to be authorized as a **device** for Spotify. To do this, we use your username and password for Spotify. These must be entered as well, or you will receive an error message like:\n\n`I couldn't find any Spot-ify devices.  This skill requires a Spotify Premium account to work properly.`\n\nwhen you try to use the **Skill** on a Mycroft device.\n\nIf you log in to Spotify using Facebook, your password will be your _Facebook_ password, but your Spotify device username. You can get your Spotify device username [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/set-device-password/).\n\n_NOTE: You MUST have a Premium Spotify account to use this **Skill**. It will NOT work with a free Spotify account._\nIt is recommended to set the DEVICE_NAME to the name of the Mycroft unit (as registered at home.mycroft.ai) for automatic identification:\n * set your Spotify username and password under OPTIONS",

            "description": "This skill adds [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) support to [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/).\nThe skill use Remember The Milk's [rest interface](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/api/).\nThe purpose if the skill is to allow operations suited for a voice interface. It is not an attempt to cover all functionality of remember the milk.\n\nAn authentication flow must be executed before other operations can be\ndone, see section [Configuration](##Configuration)\nSome advice on installation can be found in section [Installation](##Installation)\n\n### The dialog\nThe cows lists work with lists and tasks. When you mention a list or a task in a command to the cows lists,\nit will be remenbered for a short time (2 minutes). The task or list is said to be in context. Whthin this time, further commands to the cows list will refer to the list and/or task in context.\nFor instance:\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find bananas on the grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I found bananas on list grocery\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete it\"\n* Mycroft: \"bananas on list grocery was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, read the list\"\n* Mycroft: \"List grocery has 3 tasks on it, potatos, apples, oranges\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete oranges\"\n* Mycroft: \"oranges on list grocery was marked complete\"\n\nSome commands support special dialogs. For instance\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add bananas to the grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"bananas was added to list grocery\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add oranges\"\n* Mycroft: \"oranges, anything else?\"\n* You: \"appels\"\n* Mycroft: \"apples, anything else?\"\n* You: \"potatos\"\n* Mycroft: \"potatos, anything else?\"\n* You: \"no\"\n* Mycroft: \"okay, the tasks are added to list grocery\"\n\nThe skill will try to recognize mispronounced list or task names, for example:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find call back on my bin box list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I can't find a list called bin box, do you want to use the list inbox instead?\"\n* You: \"yes\"\n* Mycroft: \"I did not find call back, but i did find call home on list inbox\"\n\n\n#### Commands\nThis section lists all available commands.\n\nIn general, for all operations below, you can substitute \"my\" list with \"the\" list, i.e. \"add milk to the grocery list\" and \"add milk to my grocery list\" are both valid.\n\nBe careful about using the word 'list' when you name the lists in Remember The Milk. For instance, the skill can handle a list called 'grocery' OR a list called 'grocery list', but if you have BOTH, the skill will only find the 'grocery list'.\n\n#### Add a task\nFor example:\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add milk to my grocery list\"\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add remember to call home to list Inbox\"\n\nThe skill is using Remember The Milk [\"smart add\"](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=basics.smartadd.whatis.) For example:\n\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add remember to call home tomorrow at 9 to list Inbox\"\n\nwill add a task called \"remember to call home\" to the Remember The Milk's Inbox, and set the due date to tomorrow at 9. See also the due command later in this section.\n\n#### Complete task\nComplete a task on a list, the operation can be undone within 2 minutes:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete call home on my personal list\"\n* Mycroft: \"Call home on list personal was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, restore\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have restored call home on list personal again\"\n\n#### Complete all tasks on a list\nComplete all tasks on a list, this operation may take a while if there are many tasks. The operation can be undone within 2 minutes:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete all tasks on my grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"3 tasks on list grocery was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, restore\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have restored 3 tasks on list grocery again\"\n\nTo keep processing time down, a maximum of 40 tasks can be deleted for each complete list command. The\nRTM api has a rate limit of 1 call per second, 40 tasks will take approximately 40 seconds to complete.\nIf you use the Mycroft \"stop\" command during processing, it may not be possible to undo the operation.\n\n#### Due tasks\nFind out what tasks are due. Due date can be one of: \"now, yesterday, today, tomorrow, monday, tuesday, wedensday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday\"\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, what is on my inbox list today\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 2 tasks on it, call home, go fishing\"\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add go fishing today to the inbox list\"\n* Mycroft: \"go fishing today was added to list inbox\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, what is due today\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 1 task on it, that are due today, go fishing\"\n\n#### Find task on list\nFind a task on a list:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find milk on my grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I found milk on list grocery\"\n\n#### Read list\nRead the tasks on a list:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, read list inbox\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 2 tasks on it, call home, go fishing\"\n\n#### Undo\nIf an operation makes changes to your lists or tasks, it can be undone within 2 minutes, for example:\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add call home to list inbox\"\n* Mycroft: \"call home was added to list inbox\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, undo\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have removed call home from list inbox again\"\n\nThe words \"undo\", \"revert\", \"roll back\" and \"restore\" can be used\n\n#### Report an error\nIn case of a technical error, the cows lists will ask you if you want a mail with the details. Answer yes, and you will receive a mail from Mycroft with further details on how to report the issue, and all the details about the error.\nYou receive the mail, it is not sent the skill developer. The mail contains detalis about how to report the error to the skill developer,\nand you decide what information to put in the issue report.\n\nOther issues that are not caught as describe above, can be reported as well, on https://github.com/CarstenAgerskov/skill-the-cows-lists/issues.",

This skill interfaces with the server through the REST api.\n\n### Mycroft Setup\n\nMycroft needs to be pointed to the mopidy server, this is easily done using the skill settings page on Mycroft-Home. By default it will try to connect to a mopidy server on localhost.\n\n### Mopidy Setup\n\nI recommend using the official [mopidy install guide](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/) to get the software for your specific system.\n\nIn addition to the base installation of mopidy the skill REQUIRES the local-mysql plugin to fetch the metadata from the local library and should be able to use the data from the `mopidy-gmusic` plugin.\n\nMopidy configuration is complex and this description will only touch the areas that are relevant for the skill. Mopidy settings are made in *~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf* for a desktop install and under */etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf* for picroft/Mark-1 (if it doesn't exist it needs to be created).\n\nThis readme only covers the basics, for more details check out the official documentation at https://www.mopidy.com\n\n#### Local music\n\nFor playing music from the local file system or file share check under the heading\n\n` [local] `\n\nand make sure the following config options are set according to your system\n\n```\nenabled = true\nlibrary = sqlite\nmedia_dir = PATH_TO_YOUR_MUSIC\n```\n\nafter this is done scan the local collection by running\n\n` mopidy local scan `",

The Mycroft device's Name (set at [Home](https://home.mycroft.ai/) -- check by asking \"what is your name?\")\ncan be used to find lights and/or groups with begin with that same name. For example, if your Mycroft device's location is set to 'Kitchen' and you say \"Turn on the light\", lights with the following names would be turned on:\n\nIt will NOT turn on a light called \"Porch off the kitchen\".\n\nYou can also include the light/group name in your request, along with intensity words, such as: `bright`, `dim`, `full`, `half`, `completely`, `partially`\nKitchen\n * Kitchen sink\n * Kitchen fan (group consisting of 'Fan 1', 'Fan 2', 'Fan 3')",

            "description": "This is a 3rd party skill that uses keywords to get either a server's ping time or status via ICMP echo requests. This can be used to check that a server is responding correctly. Alternatively, one can use this to send simple HTTP GET requests to a server to start or stop services. By using the Network Ping Skill, custom commands can be created for webhook-enabled online services.\n\nFor instance, saying, *Mycroft: Send a Ping to network node Google* garners a reply of `Pinged in 9.03 milliseconds.`\n\nIf a keyword is set to get the server response, then Mycroft will reply, `Server says: OK 200`, or ` Bad Gateway 502`, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nConfiguration of network node aliases is stored in a text file, `hosts.txt`, with one \"keyword,setting,URL\" per line:\n\n    google,0,https://google.com\n    \nThis line will tell the Ping Skill that **google** is the keyword, **0** is for a *Ping* response and then the URL to ping. Alternatively, this\n\n    linux,1,https://linux.com\n    \nwill respond to the **linux** keyword and return the server *Status* of `linux.com`, because of the **1** after the keyword.\n\nIf you are running server software that can respond to GET requests, such as [Huginn](https://github.com/cantino/huginn), or there is a webservice without a prepackaged Mycroft skill that accepts webhooks, then a line like\n\n    hug, 1, https://www.HuginnDomain.com/users/1/web_requests/2/supersecretstring?service=start\n\nand the corresponding settings on the remote end will make the Ping Skill into a basic remote control. Saying *Mycroft: Send a Ping Hug* will load that URL, which will execute code on the server. Mycroft will reply, in the case of Huginn with a default Webhook Agent, with the custom server response, `Event Created 201`, to confirm the instruction was received and followed.",

to install the skill :\n\n```sh\n$ cd mycroft-core/msm/\n$ ./msm install https://github.com/ldevalbray/mycroft-social-network-manager\n```\n\nInstalling Mycroft-Social-Network-Manager skill should automatically install [browser_service](https://github.com/JarbasAl/browser_service), another skill that you'll need to run Mycroft-Social-Network-Manager. \n\nHowever, browser_service should be made into a priority skill in the mycroft config file :\n\n```sh\n$ cd mycroft-core/mycroft/configuration/\n```\n\nOpen the **mycroft.conf** file with your favourite text editor\n\n```sh\n    // General skill values\n      \"skills\": {\n        ...\n        // priority skills to be loaded first\n        \"priority_skills\": [\"skill-pairing\", \"browser_service\"],\n        ...\n      },\n```\n\n### Requirements\n\nIn order to run the skill you will need to create two apps, one on Facebook and one on Twitter.\n\nOnce this done, you will need to configure **facebook login module** on the facebook app and configure it for **devices** (Activate \"\nLogin from Devices\" in your Facebook Login settings).\n\nThen, all what's left to do is enter those informations in [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai/)\n\n```sh\n    {\n        \"name\": \"LoginFB\",\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"FacebookEmail\",\n                \"type\":

the skill to fully work, all those informations should be entered.\n\n### Testing\n\nFor testing, we use [Mycroft automatic testing](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/skills/automatic-testing/).\nAll the tests are in *mycroft-social-network-manager/test/intent/*\n\nIn order to test the skill, you will need to **switch branch** on Mycroft-core to [feature/carstens-skill-tester](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/tree/feature/carstens-skill-tester)\n\n```sh\ngit checkout origin/feature/carstens-skill-tester\n```\n\n(You'll maybe need to redo the changes to **mycroft.conf** we've done in the master/dev branch about the priority skills --> see *Instalation*)\n\nThen, **go to** *mycroft-core/test/integrationtests/skills/*, **start** *Mycroft virtualenv* and **run** *skill_developers_testrunner.py*\n\n```sh\ncd /test/integrationtests/skills/\nworkon mycroft\npython skill_developers_testrunner.py\n```\n\nThis should run the tests\n\n### Tech\n\nMycroft-Social-Network-Manager uses a number of open source projects and languages to work properly:\n\n\nAnd of course Mycroft-Social-Network-Manager itself is open source with a [public repository][public-repo] on GitHub.\n\n\n\n   [mycroftwebsite]: <https://mycroft.ai/>\n   [public-repo]:<https://github.com/ldevalbray/mycroft-social-network-manager>\nLogin to twitter and facebook\n * Logout from twitter and facebook ( !! Be careful with the use of logout, it will erase the facebook and twitter app access tokens you have entered in Mycroft Home !! )\n * Send a message to a friend\n * Post / tweet something on your wall\n * Post / tweet something to a friend's wall (tags the friend in your tweet on Tweeter)\n * Comment something on a friend profile picture\n * Like a friend profile picture\n * Know your number of friends of Facebook\n * Retweet the last tweet of a friend\n * Reads the last tweet of a friend\n * [Python] - The Mycroft language\n * [python-twitter] - A Twitter SDK made for Python\n * [Facebook SDK for Python] -  A Facebook SDK made for Python\n * [Selenium] - Using selenium threw a Mycroft skill called browser_service\n * [fbchat] - Library that uses Selenium to send messages to facebook friends\n * [Levenshtein] - In order to compare Strings",
